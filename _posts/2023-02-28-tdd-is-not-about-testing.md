Test Driven Development (TDD) is a widely-used software development technique that involves writing automated tests before writing the code that implements a feature. However, one of the biggest misconceptions about TDD is that it's all about testing. In fact, as this article by Lucas da Costa explains, TDD is not primarily about writing tests, but about using tests as a tool for designing and refining code.

By using TDD, developers can define a clear goal for a feature or function, write tests to guide the development process, and then use those tests as feedback mechanisms to ensure that the code is meeting the desired specifications. TDD can help developers avoid "code smells" and other problems by encouraging them to write small, focused functions that are easy to test and maintain. The end result is often better code, improved productivity, and a more enjoyable development experience.

So if you're interested in improving your software development process, don't think of TDD as just another testing technique. Instead, think of it as a way to build software incrementally, with feedback loops that guide and refine your code as you go. Check out [this article](https://lucasfcosta.com/2018/10/18/TDD-is-not-about-tests.html) for more information and give TDD a try in your next project.
