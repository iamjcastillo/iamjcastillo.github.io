As a software developer, I firmly believe that practicing coding katas can greatly enhance our skills in Test-Driven Development (TDD). It's a fantastic way to improve our ability to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code while following the principles of TDD.

Moreover, I'm a big fan of pair programming, where two developers collaborate on a task while working together on the same computer. I find that pair programming can be a powerful way to enhance our overall development skills and produce higher-quality code.

Recently, as an experiment, I decided to take my skills to the next level and engage in a coding kata with ChatGPT using the ping-pong pair programming technique. In this post, I'd like to share my experience with this unique form of collaboration and how it helped me sharpen my skills in TDD, coding, and pair programming.


### The experiment

First of all, I created the first test and asked it to develop the code.


Here, I encounter the first interesting finding. ChatGPT provided me the solution to the **whole** kata.

Following TDD principles I tried to get **only** the necessary code.

As soon as I entered the next test. It was able to infere the solution again.


At this point, I decided to try a different aproach and start again, using less meaningful names this time. 

The new approach worked well for the couple first iterations. 

It didn't come as a surprise that, after the third iteration, it was able to get the full solution again. 


### Afterthoughts 

In conclusion, the experiment with ChatGPT was a fun and unique experience that allowed me to practice coding katas in a different way. It was an good opportunity to test my skills in TDD, coding, and pair programming while also exploring the capabilities and limitations of a language model like ChatGPT.

I found the exercise to be very productive in terms of improving my skills while also providing an opportunity to collaborate with an AI language model. It was a great way to sharpen my skills while still being able to experiment with ChatGPT's capabilities.

Overall, I recommend trying out pair programming and coding katas with a language model like ChatGPT, as it can be an excellent way to enhance your skills as a developer and explore new possibilities in AI-assisted development.
