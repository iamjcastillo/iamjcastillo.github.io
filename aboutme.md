My name is Jesús Castillo.

I'm a software engineer with experience in Python and React, I have had the opportunity to work with a wide range of programming languages, including TypeScript, Java, and Swift. I'm a true generalist at heart, and I am passionate about constantly learning and sharing my knowledge with my team.

I am passionate about working in cross-functional teams, as I believe that this approach is critical to the success of any software project. I thrive in team environments where I can contribute my skills and expertise while learning from my colleagues. I am always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow as a engineer. 

As a lifelong learner, I am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and expertise. Whether it's exploring new programming languages or learning about emerging technologies, I am committed to staying at the forefront of the industry.

I am excited to be using ChatGPT to generate this text, as it showcases my interest in exploring new technologies and tools. As a software engineer, I understand the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

Thank you for taking the time to read my profile. I am always happy to connect with fellow professionals in the software development industry.
